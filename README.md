If you have many URLs in your Bookmarks or History and you are worried about the webpages disappearing before you get to read them again, run this tool to do a bulk archive of the URLs.

Store metadata around webpages of interest, request URLs and store HTML responses in a database. Input is required as text files, which could come from browser History or Bookmark data.
