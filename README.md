> Create local HTML snapshots of given URLs

If you have many URLs in your Bookmarks or History and you are worried about the webpages disappearing before you get to read them again, run this tool to do a bulk archive of the URLs.

Store metadata around webpages of interest, request URLs and store HTML responses in a database. Input is required as text files, which could come from browser History or Bookmark data.
